# Job Application App

## Overview
The Job Application App is a mobile application built with React Native that helps users search and apply for job opportunities. The app features a login page and a home page that displays popular and featured job listings.

## Login Page
The login page allows users to log in to the app using their name and email address. It also provides options for users to log in using their Apple, Google, or Facebook accounts.

### Features
- Name and email input fields
- Login button
- Alternative login options (Apple, Google, Facebook)
- "Haven't an account? Register" link

### Implementation
The login page is implemented using the LoginPage component, which is located in the src/components/LoginPage.js file. This component uses React Native's built-in components such as View, TextInput, TouchableOpacity, and Image to create the user interface.

The component uses the useState hook to manage the state of the name and email input fields. The handleLogin function can be implemented to handle the login logic, which could include validating the input fields and making an API call to authenticate the user.

The styles for the login page are defined using the StyleSheet API, which allows you to create styles that can be applied to the various components.

## Home Page
The home page displays a list of popular and featured job listings. Users can browse through the job listings and apply for the ones they're interested in.

### Features
- Popular job listings section
- Featured job listings section
- Job card component
- Navigation to job details page

### Implementation
The home page is implemented using the HomePage component, which is located in the src/components/HomePage.js file. This component uses React Native's built-in components such as View, FlatList, and TouchableOpacity to create the user interface.

The HomePage component fetches the data for the popular and featured job listings from an API and passes it down to the PopularJobsSection and FeaturedJobsSection components, respectively. These components use the JobCard component to render the individual job listings.

The styles for the home page are also defined using the StyleSheet API.
